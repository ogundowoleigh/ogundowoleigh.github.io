							<p class="h5">Teaching Africa how to play</p>
							<p> Globally there is a balance between Sports and Casino/Bingo/Poker. However in Nigeria and Africa as at early 2018, over 90% of gambling proceeds were from Sports Betting or Lottery. Also, the players were predominantly male.
							</p>

							<p>No one was Bingo+Slots focused. Betty intended to be the first to bring real money gaming entertainment to a female first audience across Africa.</p>
								
							<img src="../images/content/stutern-8.png">
							<p class="h5">Problem Space</p>
							
							<p>No one knew what Bingo was. Out of a survey filled by 87 people only 2 people indicated that they had heard about the game before and that it involved numbers. Neither of these 2 actually knew how to play.</p>
							<br>

							<p class="h5">Solution</p>
							<p>Use tools (onboarding and videos) to teach players how to play while also providing them with the most thrilling online gaming entertainment experience possible, in the safest and most secure environment.</p>
							<br>
							
							<p class="h5">Impact & Outcomes</p>
							<p>Increase in the number of registrations. More jackpot winners. Higher customer retention an acquisition of new customers.</p>
							<br>
							
							<p class="h5">Role</p>
							<p>I joined Betty as a product designer but was promoted to Design Manager in 9 months. I was responsible for end-to-end creative direction of the website and web campaigns, from defining complex user-stories, wire-frames and prototyping to visual design.</p>
							<br>

							<p class="h5">Tools</p>
							<p>Figma + Photoshop for UI Design, Google Form for Surveys, Proto for Prototyping</p>
							<br>

							<p class="h5">Understanding the Users</p>
							<p>Betty Bingo from inception had always set out to capture a demographic that seemed to be left out of monetary gaming in Africa: women. I did some research by exploring the material sports betting and lottery companies put out and ascertained that the marketing was tailored to men. The interfaces of their sites were usually darker. With the TV ads, the language was 'grittier' and more direct.</p>

							<p>But what do women want? In order to gain a better understanding, I conducted user research by speaking with 11 women who cut across a wide range of interests.<br>
							Synthesing the data from the conversations with these women highlighted 5 key points:</p>
							<li></li>
							<p>Based on these points I created a persona</p>
							<br>

							<img src="../images/content/stutern-design-process.png">
							<p class="h5">Research: The Edtech Industry</p>
							<p>Stutern’s services had evolved over time, but understandably - the site had not. The lean (and extremely busy) team prioritises the wellbeing, development and success of their learners above everything else. A look at their Trello boards, and I was in awe of how much work they churned out.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p>I began by evaluating the edtech industry. What companies are in the market? What courses do they offer? What are their business models? It was an interesting starting point that provided a lot of  perspective and context. <br>
							</p>

							<img src="../images/content/stutern-competitive-audit.png">

							<br>
							<p>After that I went on to  perform a thorough analysis of the website, exploring what existed and where there was room for further development. A few things were noted:</p>
							<li>The only description for the courses were the short subsection on the homepage. I found that people who were looking to get into Tech but did not understand the landscape had a hard time trying to select which was best suited to their interests. </li><br>
							<li>It was challenging to find information about the course structures, or how the program ran. How long do the classes last for? What is the entire program breakdown like?</li><br>
							<li>Information about payment was included as body text within a section of the application form. A lot of users missed this. Customer Support noted this as on of the top enquiries from learners.</li><br>
							<li>The application process felt like it was in silos.</li><br>
							<li>There were also some inconsistencies with brand application. Font and colour varied across a number of pages.</li>

							<img src="../images/content/stutern-old-site-1.png">
							

							<p class="h5">Problem Definition</p>
							<p>Stutern did not have the information that prospective learners needed to make their application process fast and seamless.</p> <br>



							<p class="h5">Use Cases</p>
							<p>I interviewed 18 people, ranging from people who had no prior knowledge of how Stutern worked to users who had already enrolled for one of their programs. I also inerviewed staff repsonsible for responding to email and phonecall enquiries, as well as staff who had worked on managing previous cohorts the company had trained. With the information gathered, I was able to define relevant personas.</p>

							<img src="../images/content/stutern-frequently-asked-questions.png">

							<p class="h5">Feature Narrative</p>
							<p>To create an experience that makes it easy for prospective learners to choose a course of study and apply for this course easily. The key elements to achieve these are:

							<li> Understanding the Program: Information is provided about what the program is, and how the core structure of the program runs.</li>
							<li> Choosing a Course: Broad course descriptions are provided with curriculum and timetable to enable users make more informed desicions.</li>
							<li> Payment Plans: Users can view and compare available options on how to pay for the courses</li>
							<li> Application Process: Let users know how the application process is supposed to go</li>
							<li> FAQs: Users come here to see Frequently Asked Questions. Questions and responses are grouped into categories for easy reference.</li>

<p class="h5">Homepage</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time designing this page because the old site had a high bounce rate and it was important I worked on getting the percentage down. From the conversations we had had with learners (current & prospective), it was clear what the key points where and I did my best to design to 'sell' Stutern to them.</p>

							<p class="h5">Social Media</p>
<p>I had to combine some graphic design and marketing skills to increase traffic and help push the number of applications for the upcoming cohort. I used my graphic design skills to create pages & posts that would appeal to our target audience and used my experience with marketing to determine what content was appropriate and supported how the company wanted to position itself.</p>

<img src="../images/content/stutern-sm-1.png">


<p class="h5">Final Notes</p>
<p>All in all, I really enjoyed working with the team and doing impactful work. The engagement on the support lines reduced drastically as prospective learners had most of the information they needed to make their decisions. Average weekly phone calls dropped by about 60% while emails dropped by 74%! To see the impact of how proper information presentation helps business operations in real life was very rewarding. </p>

<p>At the end of February 2020, I will update this post to reflect what the conversion rate was (comparing the ratio of learners that applied to learners that enrolled). Although, looking at the numbers and trends from previous cohorts, I can tell confidently that the outcome looks very promising. </p>
