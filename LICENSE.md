# License
Did you know that when you purchase an item from us, you're actually purchasing a license to use that item?
So it pays to understand our licenses!

The majority of our items (themes, code etc.) are covered by **Envato Standard Licenses**. If your end product including the item is going to be free to the end user then a **Regular License** is what you need. An **Extended License** is required if the end user must pay to use the end product.
